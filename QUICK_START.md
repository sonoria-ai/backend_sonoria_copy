# ðŸš€ Voice Assistant Quick Start Guide

## âš¡ 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Add Twilio Credentials (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio and sign up
2. Get your credentials from the console
3. Edit `.env` file:

```bash
# Replace these with your actual Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_actual_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+15551234567
```

### Step 2: Start Server (30 seconds)

**Terminal 1 - Django**:
```bash
cd sonoria_backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2 - ngrok**:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok URL (looks like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### Step 3: Configure Twilio (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
2. Click your phone number
3. Under "Voice Configuration":
   - Webhook: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/assistant/incoming-call/?org_id=1`
   - Method: `POST`
4. Click Save

### Make a Call

Call your Twilio number from your phone and try:

1. **"I want to book an appointment"**
   - âœ… Should send you booking SMS

2. **"What are your hours?"**
   - âœ… Should answer from database

3. **"I want to speak to a manager"**
   - âœ… Should transfer call

### Check Logs

In Terminal 1 (Django server), you'll see:
```
INFO: Incoming call from +15551234567 for organization 1
INFO: User: I want to book an appointment
INFO: Function called: book_service
INFO: Booking SMS sent successfully
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "No organization found"

- Or change `org_id=1` to your actual organization ID in webhook URL

### "Twilio not configured"
- Check `.env` has correct Twilio credentials
- Restart Django server after updating `.env`

### "OpenAI API error"
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY in `.env` is correct
- Check OpenAI account has credits

### Call doesn't connect
- Verify ngrok is running
- Check Twilio webhook URL is correct
- Ensure webhook method is POST

### No SMS received
- Check Twilio phone number is verified
- View Django logs for errors
