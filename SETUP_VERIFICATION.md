```

Get credentials from: https://console.twilio.com/

### OpenAI API Key (ALREADY CONFIGURED ‚úÖ)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-... (already set)
```

## üöÄ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start Django Server
```bash
cd sonoria_backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Start ngrok (in new terminal)
```bash
# Install ngrok if not already installed
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or download from https://ngrok.com/download

# Start tunnel
ngrok http 8000
```

### Step 3: Configure Twilio
1. Copy ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
2. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
3. Select your Twilio phone number
4. Under "Voice Configuration":
   - Webhook URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/assistant/incoming-call/?org_id=1`
   - Method: `POST`
5. Save configuration

### Step 4: Test Call Flow
1. Call your Twilio number from your phone
2. Expected flow:
   - ‚úÖ Assistant greets with: "hi how are you" (from database)
   - ‚úÖ Say: "I want to book an appointment"
   - ‚úÖ Receive SMS with booking link
   - ‚úÖ Check Django logs for full transcript

### Step 5: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# View generated prompt
curl http://localhost:8000/assistant/get-prompt/?org_id=1

# Test SMS (requires Twilio credentials)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/assistant/send-sms/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "+1234567890", "message": "Test message"}'
```
